Run `make` and the executeable `smash` will be generated.

To run:

```
./smash <FILE>
```

Two files will be made.
`ast.dot` and `fc.dot`

Run:

```
dot -Tpdf ast.dot -o ast.pdf
dot -Tpdf fc.dot -o fc.pdf
```

to create the appropriate PDF.

This is the repository for ***CutLang: A Particle Physics Analysis Description Language Runtime Interpreter***.
CutLang is a domain-specific language and interpreter for cut-based HEP data analysis. It allows users to write analysis in ADL (Analysis Description Language) files, which are then interpreted by the CutLang framework at run time. The interpreter is implemented in C++ and is built on top of the CERN data analysis framework ROOT. CutLang offers several features to make data analysis more efficient and error-free, including object definitions, event selections, histogramming, and Monte Carlo weighting. It also supports multi-core/multi-CPU hardware and has the ability to save events at any stage of the analysis. The latest version CutLang V3 uses the Lex/Yacc-based approach for ADL file processing and has several enhancements over the previous version, including improved handling of object combinatorics, the ability to include tables and weights and support for more complex algorithms. By providing a standard and human-readable way for writing and interpretation, CutLang and ADL is aiming to advance the field of HEP data analysis.



### What is ADL?
ADL (Analysis Description Language) is a domain-specific language used to describe and implement analysis in high-energy particle physics experiments. ADL allows users to write HEP analyses in a clear and easily readable format. ADL is written in a way that is independent of any specific computing framework, making it easier to share and compare analyses between different users and experiments. It is used to define the criteria for selecting events of interest and to specify how the selected events should be processed (e.g. by calculating certain variables or performing specific cuts). ADL is typically used in conjunction with a Monte Carlo simulation to generate samples of events and a data analysis framework to process the events and produce results. You can read more about it [here](http://cern.ch/adl).

### <a name="using-cutlang-with-jupyter"></a> &#9670; <ins>with Jupyter</ins>
Available on **Linux, macOS, Windows**

:warning: *In order to run CutLang in Jupyter, you must first complete the setup from source or with Conda or Docker.*

### <a name="using-cutlang-with-jupyter-setup"></a> &#9655;	Setup
- You should have completed the CutLang setup and be able to run the CLA command without any problems.

### <a name="using-cutlang-with-jupyter-starting"></a> &#9655;	Starting
*Starts Jupyter with "ROOT c++ with CutLang" kernel in your current directory*
```bash
  CLA_Jupyter lab
  # or
  CLA_Jupyter notebook
  # Jupyter will be started, you can use by using the link 127.0.0.1:8888/... in the logs
```

### <a name="jupyter-cutlang-magic"></a> &#9655; Jupyter CutLang Magic
CutLang can be used on Jupyter notebooks with ROOT
- You can see how to use ROOT notebooks from the [link](https://root.cern.ch/notebooks/HowTos/HowTo_ROOT-Notebooks.html)
- You can also run CutLang on any cell as (For detailed information, you can check the [tutorial](#tutorial) section.)
```bash
%%cutlang file=<root-file-name> filetype=<root-file-type> ...
```

## <a name="running-cutlang"></a> Running CutLang

CutLang can be run anywhere using the `CLA` (shell script) or using the `CLA.py` scripts.

```bash
 CLA (or CLA.py) [inputrootfile] [inputeventformat] -i [adlfilename.adl] -e [numberofevents]
 # Also, you can start simultaneous processes, which can increase the analysis speed tremendously.
 CLA (or CLA.py) [inputrootfile] [inputeventformat] -i [adlfilename.adl] -e [numberofevents] -j 0
 # When you enter 0 in the j flag, it will start the process as much as the number of processor cores, if you want, you can set the number of processes by changing the value from 0.
 # for example:
 # CLA (or CLA.py) [inputrootfile] [inputeventformat] -i [adlfilename.adl] -e [numberofevents] -j 8
 # above command starts 8 simultaneous processes
```
- Input event formats can be: *DELPHES, CMSNANO, LHCO, FCC, ATLASVLL, ATLASOD, CMSOD, VLLBG3 and LVL0 (CutLang internal format)*
- Number of events is optional.

The output will be saved in `histoOut-[adlfilename].root`.  This ROOT file will have a separate directory for each search region, which contains the relevant histograms and ADL content defining the region. The histogram(s) `cutflow` (and `bincounts`, in case search bins are specified in the region) exist by default.

### <ins> Getting Started with Examples: </ins>

First, download some simple event samples:

```bash
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/zza28peyjy8qgg6/T2tt_700_50.root
```

The samples contain SUSY events in DELPHES format.

ADL syntax is self-descriptive. One can study and run several tutorial examples to learn the main syntax rules. These examples can be seen by:

```bash
ls /CutLang/runs/tutorials/*.adl
```

Read the ADL files in the tutorials directory to understand the algorithm and syntax. Then run the ADL files with the commands given below. If there are histograms made, check out the resulting ROOT file and inspect the histograms.

```bash
CLA T2tt_700_50.root DELPHES -i /CutLang/runs/tutorials/ex05_functions.adl
```
```bash
CLA T2tt_700_50.root DELPHES -i /CutLang/runs/tutorials/ex06_bins.adl
```
```bash
CLA T2tt_700_50.root DELPHES -i /CutLang/runs/tutorials/ex12_counts.adl
```

More ADL files for various full LHC analyses (focusing on signal region selections) can be found in [this git repository.](https://github.com/ADL4HEP/ADLLHCanalyses)
